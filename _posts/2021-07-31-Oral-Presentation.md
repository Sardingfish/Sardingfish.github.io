这段时间一直都想总结整理一下前段时间为了准备IAG会议搜集的一些关于如何做好一场英文口头报告的资料，由于拖延症爆发一直拖到了今天。

作为学术3P (Paper, Poster, Presentation)之一的Presentation对于科研人员的重要性不言而喻，而作为非英语母语国家的科研人员，要做好一场好的英文口头报告，自然要多花些时间准备。这里整理收集了报告的种类、如何准备一场口头报告，以及如何应对观众的提问，希望对萌新们有用。



#### Type of Talk

通常情况下会议报告根据报告人和邀请方式的的不同可以分为Plenary talk，Keynote talk跟普通的Oral talk三种。

> **Plenary talk**：也叫大会全体特邀报告，一般能给邀请做特邀报告的人都是业界知名大牛。这种报告一般是一个小时的样子。报告的内容覆盖面也比较广，往往涵盖了好几个研究方向，报告的方式也是高瞻远瞩，在很高的位置看总结研究方向的过去，展望未来。如果是一个实验室负责人做这个报告，通常会报告他们整个实验室涉及到的比较有代表性的研究。特邀报告一般都是安排在一天报告的第一二个，而有时候会议安排比较紧的话，这种报告会很早就开始。

> **Keynote talk**： 同样也是邀请报告，报告内容是某个具体方向上比较重要的结果。所以面向的对象就不是全体会议人员，而是对某个研究方向有兴趣的人。这种报告一般是30分钟，也有45分钟的。做报告的人一般是某个项目的负责人，基本上都是在第一线工作的科研人员，所以这种报告也是比较接地气，大致上还能听得明白。如果有问题的话，也可以得到比较具体的回答，更有实际意义。

> **Oral talk**： 普通口头报告通常是投稿制，需要报告人预先投递摘要，审核通过后再邀请报告。这类报告通常针对非常细分的研究领域，内容也是集中在一个很小的研究课题上，通常学生接触最多的就是普通的口头报告。



#### Presentation 

**# 四个内容**

听报告的观众通常关注以下四个内容，所以我们准备报告的时候也应当从以下四个方面准备：

(1) Why did you do this? 首先需要阐明我们为什么要做这个研究，这个研究的意义是什么，研究背景是什么？

(2) How did you do it? 其次解释我们是如何做的，用到了什么材料，使用了什么方法，处理策略是什么？

(3) What are the results? 接下来展示实验结果。

(4) What is your interpretation? 最后解释实验结果产生的原因，如何从该结果得到结论。
